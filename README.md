# NgrxFunProject

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.3.

Since I started working with React I was trying to understand my unreasonable abhorrence of Redux. A year later Angular is the main framework that I use in my current company. As that happened, I decided to create a simple app with NGRX. Furthermore, it was a challenge for me as I remember struggling a lot to comprehend basic concepts about actions. I used angular-in-memory-wep-api to load the products and initialize the store. I created an effect to handle product success and product failure. Is a CRUD APP that I create in my free time and a chance to build a repo with maintainable and easy-to-follow code. As a junior developer, it was also a good opportunity for understanding and following Container vs Presentational Components approach.
